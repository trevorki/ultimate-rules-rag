- Force sideline – Using a mark to push the thrower toward whichever sideline is closest and not allowing a throw toward the middle of the field; this often results in the force switching directions throughout the possession.
- Force straight-up – Standing directly between the thrower and the end zone, using a mark to push throws to go toward either sideline but not up the middle of the field; equivalent to 'force flat.'

While ultimate is often played primarily to a point total, there are typically predetermined time limitations on the length of a game. At the hard cap — the predetermined end time — the current point is completed and the team with the higher score wins. In the case of a tie, one final point is played.

# 2024-2025 Official Rules of Ultimate

Ultimate is a sport that inspires players and fans alike because of its ability to develop and showcase the athleticism, skill, teamwork, and character of its participants. The arc of the disc in flight, the opportunity for each individual to contribute equally to their team's success, and the trust given to each player to know and uphold the rules make ultimate a sport that is embraced for its fun and excitement on the field and for the community beyond it. As a low-cost sport requiring minimal equipment, offering single and mixed-gender play, and providing a format that builds communication and conflict resolution skills, ultimate provides a welcoming, high value experience for players and fans from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences. The Official Rules of Ultimate 2024-2025 describes how the game is played, including how players self-officiate and apply the principles of Spirit of the Game in competition.

## 1 Introduction

The introduction describes Ultimate as a non-contact, self-officiated disc sport played by two teams of seven players. The aim is to score goals by catching legal passes in the attacking end zone, with the disc advanced through passes without running. Turnovers happen when passes are incomplete. The sport emphasizes self-officiation guided by the "Spirit of the Game."

The rules may vary, as outlined in appendices. Event organizers can modify certain logistical aspects like game length and time limits, provided changes are set prior to competition. If not determined by the event organizer, team captains can agree on variations to the rules, subject to approval.

Additionally, specific rules may override general ones in certain situations.

## 2 Spirit of the Game

The "Spirit of the Game" refers to a set of principles that emphasize fair play, where each player is responsible for maintaining integrity and respect during gameplay. Players are expected to know and follow the rules, with the assumption that no one will purposely break them. While competitive play is encouraged, it should not compromise mutual respect, rule adherence, or the enjoyment of the game.

Key aspects include:

- Rule Adherence
- Fair Conduct
- Dispute Resolution
- Promoting Good Spirit
- Violations
- Responsibility
- Communication and Bias Awareness

Decisions regarding unclear plays should be resolved collaboratively, potentially returning play to its state before the interference if consensus cannot be reached.

## 4 Playing Field

The playing field is a rectangular area that should be flat, free of obstructions, and safe for players, with well-trimmed grass as the recommended surface. It is marked with four perimeter lines: two sidelines running along the length and two backlines along the width, which are not part of the playing field. There are also two goal lines parallel to the backlines, separating the end zones from the central zone. Each end zone is bordered by a backline, sidelines, and a goal line.
The central zone excludes the end zones and was previously referred to as the "playing field proper." Brick marks and reverse brick marks are located in the central zone and end zones, with a midfield mark in the center. The corners of the central zone and end zones are marked with brightly colored cones or pylons.
